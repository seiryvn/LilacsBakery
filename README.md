# LilacsBakery

Top-down Pixel RPG-inspired game developed on Unity version 2021.1.24f1 (February-May 2025).
##
LilacsBakery has a bakery-themed plot, surrounding interactions with objects and dialogue with NPCs, as well as a basic melee combat and crafting system.

Throughout this project, I explored game development for the first time, experimenting with Unity, C#, and its UI features, as well as pixel art creation (Piskel) including tilemaps & sprite sheet animations.
